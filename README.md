# Kangaroo-Language-Test

This repository contains the dataset and code for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on high-school-level mathematical reasoning in Catalan, Spanish, French and English using questions from the Kangaroo Mathematics Competition (https://cangur.alcoi.upv.es/edicions.php ; https://canguromat.es ; https://www.matematica.pt/fr/utile/kangourou-sujets-solutions.php ; https://www.matematica.pt/en/useful/kangaroo-questions.php). The questions that contain any figures are gathered in a single folder. The dataset is formatted as an Excel file with questions, multiple-choice options, ground truth answers, and scores (dataset)

It includes the scripts to access models such as GPT, Qwen Gemini, Gemma, Llama, and Pixtral.

Experiments were conducted via API services and local/cloud instances for different model sizes. The raw results, as well as an updated Excel file with the response of each model and its reasoning process, are available, too (raw_responses).
